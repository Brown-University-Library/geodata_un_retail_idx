* NOTES ON UN INTERNATIONAL CIVIL SERVICE COMMISSION RETAIL PRICE INDEX DATA

The files in this folder contain retail price indices that measure the cost-of-living of United Nations international staff stationed at specific duty stations relative to New York City, the base of the United Nations post adjustment system. Most of the world's countries are included. This is non-public data that I requested from the UN, and was granted a username and password to access and download from this site:

https://unicsc.org/Home/DataRPI

This data is to be used for non-commercial research purposes by Brown university students, faculty, and staff. The files cannot be redistributed or republished, and the UN ICSC must be cited as a source when the data is used for research.

The data is published six times a year (Feb-Apr-Jun-Aug-Oct-Dec) from 2009 to present. Prior to that time, data was published four times a year (Mar-Jun-Sep-Dec) and the transition occured midway through 2008 which has five data points (Mar-Jun-Aug-Oct-Dec). 

There are two sets of files:

Retail Price Index (RPI) covers Mar 1997 to present and contains a summary for each country with the name of the duty station city, an exchange rate, local currency, a total retail index, and a total index that excludes housing. Data from Mar 2002 to present are stored in two identical files, an Excel spreadsheet and a PDF. Prior to 2002 a mix of PDF, DOC, and plain text files (stored with the extension PRN) were used. The older .xls format was used from Mar 2002 to Aug 2013, and the modern .xlsx format is used from Dec 2013 to present.

Retail Price Index with Details (RPID) covers Dec 2002 to present. Data is stored in an Excel spreadsheet with a macro that allows you to choose a single country / duty station and see how the total index for each country was weighted for different retail categories. The weight is published in USD and an index value is provided for each category. There is a worksheet for the macro and a worksheet that contains the aggregated index for all countries. The older .xls format was used from Mar 2002 to Aug 2013, and the modern .xlsm format is used from Dec 2013 to present. The files for Dec 2002 to Sep 2003 are password protected and can't be opened. 

A methodology document entitled "United Nations Post Adjustment System" is included in PDF format.
