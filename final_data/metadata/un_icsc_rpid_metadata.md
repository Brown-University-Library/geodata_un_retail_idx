# TITLE
dct_title_s: Retail Price Index by Country, World, 2004-2022

# DESCRIPTION
dct_description_sm:
- This dataset is a bimonthly time series of retail price indexes for different goods and services in countries around the world. Published by the United Nations Civil Service Commission as the Retail Price Indices with Details, it measures the cost of different goods and services at UN duty stations in order to adjust the salaries of the UN's international staff relative to the cost of living in New York City, the site of the UN Headquarters (index value of 100). There are records for each duty station (usually the capital city of a country) for a given month and year for a given good or service represented as an index and as a weighted value in nominal US dollars. The categories of goods and services include Food and Non-alcoholic Beverages, Alcoholic Beverages and Tobacco, Clothing and Footwear, Housing / Water / Electricity / Gas and Fuels, Furniture and Household Equipment and Maintenance, Health, Transport, Communication, Recreation and Culture, Education, Restaurants and Hotels, Miscellaneous Goods and Services, Medical Insurance, Pension Contributions, Out of Area Expenses (expenses by UN staff on goods or services outside the country of their duty station assignment). The Brown University Library's geospatial services team produced this time series by aggregating the data from individual year / month spreadsheets and coding the duty stations with ISO country codes. The processed data files are published in three CSV formats, as individual year-month files, as a single aggregated flat file, and as an aggregated file where goods and service categories have been pivoted from rows to columns. The library plans to update the time series on an annual basis.
